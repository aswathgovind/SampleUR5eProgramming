A  .urp program were you can teach the robot pose by using the MoveJ function. 

This urp program aids in enabling the robot to Learn by demonstration, as in move the joints by hand and make the robot to reproduce the movement you taught it.

You can create a .urp program were you can teach the robot pose by using the MoveJ function ( make sure you check the use joint values option). Then, set the way points using the free drive mode where you can move the robot by hand. I have attached a .urp file to accomplish that. All you need to do is to select the waypoint node in the polyscope GUI and change the robot pose in free drive according to your requirements. Hope this helped.
